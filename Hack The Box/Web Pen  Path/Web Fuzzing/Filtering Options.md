Web fuzzing tools like `gobuster`, `ffuf`, and `wfuzz` are designed to perform comprehensive scans, often generating a vast amount of data. Sifting through this output to identify the most relevant findings can be a daunting task. However, these tools offer powerful filtering mechanisms to streamline your analysis and focus on the results that matter most.

### Gobuster

`Gobuster` offers various filtering options depending on the module being run, to help you focus on specific responses and streamline your analysis. There is a small caveat, the `-s` and `-b` options are only available in the `dir` fuzzing mode.

|Flag|Description|Example Scenario|
|---|---|---|
|`-s` (include)|Include only responses with the specified status codes (comma-separated).|You're looking for redirects, so you filter for codes `301,302,307`|
|`-b` (exclude)|Exclude responses with the specified status codes (comma-separated).|The server returns many 404 errors. Exclude them with `-b 404`|
|`--exclude-length`|Exclude responses with specific content lengths (comma-separated, supports ranges).|You're not interested in 0-byte or 404-byte responses, so use `--exclude-length 0,404`|

By strategically combining these filtering options, you can tailor `Gobuster's` output to your specific needs and focus on the most relevant results for your security assessments.

Filtering Fuzzing Output

```shell-session
# Find directories with status codes 200 or 301, but exclude responses with a size of 0 (empty responses)
underhill341@htb[/htb]$ gobuster dir -u http://example.com/ -w wordlist.txt -s 200,301 --exclude-length 0
```

## FFUF

`FFUF` offers a highly customizable filtering system, enabling precise control over the displayed output. This allows you to efficiently sift through potentially large amounts of data and focus on the most relevant findings. `FFUF's` filtering options are categorized into multiple types, each serving a specific purpose in refining your results.

|Flag|Description|Example Scenario|
|---|---|---|
|`-mc` (match code)|Include only responses that match the specified status codes. You can provide a single code, multiple codes separated by commas, or ranges of codes separated by hyphens (e.g., `200,204,301`, `400-499`). The default behavior is to match codes 200-299, 301, 302, 307, 401, 403, 405, and 500.|After fuzzing, you notice many 302 (Found) redirects, but you're primarily interested in 200 (OK) responses. Use `-mc 200` to isolate these.|
|`-fc` (filter code)|Exclude responses that match the specified status codes, using the same format as `-mc`. This is useful for removing common error codes like 404 Not Found.|A scan returns many 404 errors. Use `-fc 404` to remove them from the output.|
|`-fs` (filter size)|Exclude responses with a specific size or range of sizes. You can specify single sizes or ranges using hyphens (e.g., `-fs 0` for empty responses, `-fs 100-200` for responses between 100 and 200 bytes).|You suspect the interesting responses will be larger than 1KB. Use `-fs 0-1023` to filter out smaller responses.|
|`-ms` (match size)|Include only responses that match a specific size or range of sizes, using the same format as `-fs`.|You are looking for a backup file that you know is exactly 3456 bytes in size. Use `-ms 3456` to find it.|
|`-fw` (filter out number of words in response)|Exclude responses containing the specified number of words in the response.|You're filtering out a specific number of words from the responses. Use `-fw 219` to filter for responses containing that amount of words.|
|`-mw` (match word count)|Include only responses that have the specified amount of words in the response body.|You're looking for short, specific error messages. Use `-mw 5-10` to filter for responses with 5 to 10 words.|
|`-fl` (filter line)|Exclude responses with a specific number of lines or range of lines. For example, `-fl 5` will filter out responses with 5 lines.|You notice a pattern of 10-line error messages. Use `-fl 10` to filter them out.|
|`-ml` (match line count)|Include only responses that have the specified amount of lines in the response body.|You're looking for responses with a specific format, such as 20 lines. Use `-ml 20` to isolate them.|
|`-mt` (match time)|Include only responses that meet a specific time-to-first-byte (TTFB) condition. This is useful for identifying responses that are unusually slow or fast, potentially indicating interesting behavior.|The application responds slowly when processing certain inputs. Use `-mt >500` to find responses with a TTFB greater than 500 milliseconds.|

You can combine multiple filters. For example:

Filtering Fuzzing Output

```shell-session
# Find directories with status code 200, based on the amount of words, and a response size greater than 500 bytes
underhill341@htb[/htb]$ ffuf -u http://example.com/FUZZ -w wordlist.txt -mc 200 -fw 427 -ms >500

# Filter out responses with status codes 404, 401, and 302
underhill341@htb[/htb]$ ffuf -u http://example.com/FUZZ -w wordlist.txt -fc 404,401,302

# Find backup files with the .bak extension and size between 10KB and 100KB
underhill341@htb[/htb]$ ffuf -u http://example.com/FUZZ.bak -w wordlist.txt -fs 0-10239 -ms 10240-102400

# Discover endpoints that take longer than 500ms to respond
underhill341@htb[/htb]$ ffuf -u http://example.com/FUZZ -w wordlist.txt -mt >500
```

### wenum

`wenum` offers a robust filtering system to help you manage and refine the vast amount of data generated during fuzzing. You can filter based on status codes, response size/character count, word count, line count, and even regular expressions.

|Flag|Description|Example Scenario|
|---|---|---|
|`--hc` (hide code)|Exclude responses that match the specified status codes.|After fuzzing, the server returned many 400 Bad Request errors. Use `--hc 400` to hide them and focus on other responses.|
|`--sc` (show code)|Include only responses that match the specified status codes.|You are only interested in successful requests (200 OK). Use `--sc 200` to filter the results accordingly.|
|`--hl` (hide length)|Exclude responses with the specified content length (in lines).|The server returns verbose error messages with many lines. Use `--hl` with a high value to hide these and focus on shorter responses.|
|`--sl` (show length)|Include only responses with the specified content length (in lines).|You suspect a specific response with a known line count is related to a vulnerability. Use `--sl` to pinpoint it.|
|`--hw` (hide word)|Exclude responses with the specified number of words.|The server includes common phrases in many responses. Use `--hw` to filter out responses with those word counts.|
|`--sw` (show word)|Include only responses with the specified number of words.|You are looking for short error messages. Use `--sw` with a low value to find them.|
|`--hs` (hide size)|Exclude responses with the specified response size (in bytes or characters).|The server sends large files for valid requests. Use `--hs` to filter out these large responses and focus on smaller ones.|
|`--ss` (show size)|Include only responses with the specified response size (in bytes or characters).|You are looking for a specific file size. Use `--ss` to find it.|
|`--hr` (hide regex)|Exclude responses whose body matches the specified regular expression.|Filter out responses containing the "Internal Server Error" message. Use `--hr "Internal Server Error"`.|
|`--sr` (show regex)|Include only responses whose body matches the specified regular expression.|Filter for responses containing the string "admin" using `--sr "admin"`.|
|`--filter`/`--hard-filter`|General-purpose filter to show/hide responses or prevent their post-processing using a regular expression.|`--filter "Login"` will show only responses containing "Login", while `--hard-filter "Login"` will hide them and prevent any plugins from processing them.|

You can combine multiple filters. For example:

Filtering Fuzzing Output

```shell-session
# Show only successful requests and redirects:
underhill341@htb[/htb]$ wenum -w wordlist.txt --sc 200,301,302 -u https://example.com/FUZZ

# Hide responses with common error codes:
underhill341@htb[/htb]$ wenu -w wordlist.txt --hc 404,400,500 -u https://example.com/FUZZ

# Show only short error messages (responses with 5-10 words):
underhill341@htb[/htb]$ wenum -w wordlist.txt --sw 5-10 -u https://example.com/FUZZ

# Hide large files and focus on smaller responses:
underhill341@htb[/htb]$ wenum -w wordlist.txt --hs 10000 -u https://example.com/FUZZ

# Filter for responses containing specific information:
underhill341@htb[/htb]$ wenum -w wordlist.txt --sr "admin\|password" -u https://example.com/FUZZ
```

## Feroxbuster

`Feroxbuster's` filtering system is designed to be both powerful and flexible, enabling you to fine-tune the results you receive during a scan. It offers a variety of filters that operate on both the request and response levels.

|Flag|Description|Example Scenario|
|---|---|---|
|`--dont-scan` (Request)|Exclude specific URLs or patterns from being scanned (even if found in links during recursion).|You know the `/uploads` directory contains only images, so you can exclude it using `--dont-scan /uploads`.|
|`-S`, `--filter-size`|Exclude responses based on their size (in bytes). You can specify single sizes or comma-separated ranges.|You've noticed many 1KB error pages. Use `-S 1024` to exclude them.|
|`-X`, `--filter-regex`|Exclude responses whose body or headers match the specified regular expression.|Filter out pages with a specific error message using `-X "Access Denied"`.|
|`-W`, `--filter-words`|Exclude responses with a specific word count or range of word counts.|Eliminate responses with very few words (e.g., error messages) using `-W 0-10`.|
|`-N`, `--filter-lines`|Exclude responses with a specific line count or range of line counts.|Filter out long, verbose pages with `-N 50-`.|
|`-C`, `--filter-status`|Exclude responses based on specific HTTP status codes. This operates as a denylist.|Suppress common error codes like 404 and 500 using `-C 404,500`.|
|`--filter-similar-to`|Exclude responses that are similar to a given webpage.|Remove duplicate or near-duplicate pages based on a reference page using `--filter-similar-to error.html`.|
|`-s`, `--status-codes`|Include only responses with the specified status codes. This operates as an allowlist (default: all).|Focus on successful responses using `-s 200,204,301,302`.|

You can combine multiple filters. For example:

Filtering Fuzzing Output

```shell-session
# Find directories with status code 200, excluding responses larger than 10KB or containing the word "error"
underhill341@htb[/htb]$ feroxbuster --url http://example.com -w wordlist.txt -s 200 -S 10240 -X "error" 
```

## A Quick Demonstration

To follow along, start the target system via the question section at the bottom of the page. Add the specified vhost to your hosts file using the command below, replacing IP with the IP address of your spawned instance. We will be using the `/usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt` wordlists for these fuzzing tasks.

Throughout the module so far, you might have noticed some of the commands have been using some sort of result filtering, or the fuzzers themselves are applying some sort of filtering. For example, for POST fuzzing with `ffuf`, if we remove the match code filter, `ffuf` will default to a series of other filters.

Filtering Fuzzing Output

```shell-session
underhill341@htb[/htb]$ ffuf -u http://IP:PORT/post.php -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -d "y=FUZZ" -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt -v

```

In the output above, the line `:: Matcher : Response status: 200-299,301,302,307,401,403,405,500` indicates that, by default, `ffuf` matches only those specific status codes. This intentional filtering minimizes the noise generated by `404 NOT FOUND` responses, ensuring that the results of interest remain prominent.

To illustrate the potential issue of not filtering, let's run the same scan while matching all status codes using the `-mc all` flag:

The resulting output becomes inundated with `404 NOT FOUND` results, making it significantly more challenging to identify any potentially valuable findings. This demonstrates the importance of employing appropriate filtering techniques to optimize the fuzzing process and prioritize meaningful results.
