`Hashcat` can be downloaded from the [website](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/) using `wget` and then decompressed using the `7z` (7-Zip file archiver) via the command line. The full help menu can be viewed by typing `hashcat -h`. The latest version of `Hashcat` at the time of writing is version 6.1.1. Version 6.0.0 was a major release that introduced several enhancements over version 5.x. Some of the changes include performance improvements and 51 new algorithms (or supported hash types, also known as hash modes) for a total of over 320 supported algorithms at the time of writing. We can also download a standalone binary of the latest release for Windows and Unix/Linux systems from Hashcat's website or compile from the source.

The `Hashcat` team does not maintain any packages, aside from the official GitHub [repo](https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat). Any other repos (i.e., installing from `apt`), are left up to the 3rd party to keep up-to-date. The latest version can always be obtained directly from their GitHub repo and install from the source. For our purposes, we will demonstrate installation within the Pwnbox, which, at the time of writing, is using the latest version (6.1.1).

The folder contains 64-bit binaries for both Windows and Linux. The `-a` and `-m` arguments are used to specify the type of attack mode and hash type. `Hashcat` supports the following attack modes:

|**#**|**Mode**|
|---|---|
|0|Straight|
|1|Combination|
|3|Brute-force|
|6|Hybrid Wordlist + Mask|
|7|Hybrid Mask + Wordlist|

The hash type value is based on the algorithm of the hash to be cracked. A complete list of hash types and their corresponding examples can be found [here](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes). The table helps in quickly identifying the number for a given hash type. You can also view the list of example hashes via the command line using the following command:

You can scroll through the list and press `q` to exit.

The benchmark test (or performance test) for a particular hash type can be performed using the `-b` flag.

#### Hashcat - Benchmark

Hashcat Overview

```shell-session
underhill341@htb[/htb]$ hashcat -b -m 0
hashcat (v6.1.1) starting in benchmark mode...

Benchmarking uses hand-optimized kernel code by default.
You can use it in your cracking session by setting the -O option.
Note: Using optimized kernel code limits the maximum supported password length.
To disable the optimized kernel code in benchmark mode, use the -w option.

```

For example, the hash rate for MD5 on a given CPU is found to be 450.7 MH/s.

We can also run `hashcat -b` to run benchmarks for all hash modes.

#### Hashcat - Optimizations

Hashcat has two main ways to optimize speed:

|Option|Description|
|---|---|
|Optimized Kernels|This is the `-O` flag, which according to the documentation, means `Enable optimized kernels (limits password length)`. The magical password length number is generally 32, with most wordlists won't even hit that number. This can take the estimated time from days to hours, so it is always recommended to run with `-O` first and then rerun after without the `-O` if your GPU is idle.|
|Workload|This is the `-w` flag, which, according to the documentation, means `Enable a specific workload profile`. The default number is `2`, but if you want to use your computer while Hashcat is running, set this to `1`. If you plan on the computer only running Hashcat, this can be set to `3`.|

It is important to note that the use of `--force` should be avoided. While this appears to make `Hashcat` work on certain hosts, it is actually disabling safety checks, muting warnings, and bypasses problems that the tool's developers have deemed to be blockers. These problems can lead to false positives, false negatives, malfunctions, etc. If the tool is not working properly without forcing it to run with `--force` appended to your command, we should troubleshoot the root cause (i.e., a driver issue). Using `--force` is discouraged by the tool's developers and should only be used by experienced users or developers.
