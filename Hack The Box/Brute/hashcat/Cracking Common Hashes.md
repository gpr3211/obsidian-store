## Common Hash Types

During penetration test engagements, we encounter a wide variety of hash types; some are extremely common and seen on most engagements, while others are seen very rarely or not at all. As stated previously, the creators of `Hashcat` maintain a list of [example hashes](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes) most hash modes that `Hashcat` supports. The list includes the hash mode, hash name, and a sample hash of the specified type. Some of the most commonly seen hashes are:

|Hashmode|Hash Name|Example Hash|

## Example 1 - Database Dumps

MD5, SHA1, and bcrypt hashes are often seen in database dumps. These hashes may be retrieved following a successful SQL injection attack or found in publicly available password data breach database dumps. MD5 and SHA1 are typically easier to crack than bcrypt, which may have many rounds of the Blowfish algorithm applied.

Let's crack some SHA1 hashes. Take the following list:

#### SHA1 Hashes List

Cracking Common Hashes

```shell-session

summertime
baconandeggs
beach1234

```

We can create a SHA1 of each word quickly:

cbfdac6008f9cab4083784cbd1874f76618d2a97
```

We can then run these through a `Hashcat` dictionary attack using the `rockyou.txt` wordlist.

The above hashes cracked very quickly as they are common words/phrases with little to no complexity. Variations on the above list, such as "`Bas3b@ll1`" or "`Wat3rSl1de`" would likely take longer to crack and may require additional techniques such as mask and hybrid attacks.

## Example 2 - Linux Shadow File

Sha512crypt hashes are commonly found in the `/etc/shadow` file on Linux systems. This file contains the password hashes for all accounts with a login shell assigned to them. We may gain access to a Linux system during a penetration test via a web application attack or successful exploitation of a vulnerable service. We may exploit a service that is already running in the context of the highest privileged `root` account and perform a successful privilege escalation attack and access the `/etc/shadow` file. Password re-use is widespread. A cracked password may give us access to other servers, network devices, or even be used as a foothold into a target's Active Directory environment.

Let's look at a hash from a standard Ubuntu installation. The corresponding plaintext for the following hash is "`password123`".

#### Root Password in Ubuntu Linux

Cracking Common Hashes

```shell-session
root:$6$tOA0cyybhb/Hr7DN$htr2vffCWiPGnyFOicJiXJVMbk1muPORR.eRGYfBYUnNPUjWABGPFiphjIjJC5xPfFUASIbVKDAHS3vTW1qU.1:18285:0:99999:7:::
```

The hash contains nine fields separated by colons. The first two fields contain the username and its encrypted hash. The rest of the fields contain various attributes such as password creation time, last change time, and expiry.

Coming to the hash, we already know that it contains three fields delimited by "`$`". The value "`6`" stands for the SHA-512 hashing algorithm; the next 16 characters represent the salt, while the rest of it is the actual hash.

Let's crack this hash using `Hashcat`.

## Example 3 - Common Active Directory Password Hash Types

Credential theft and password re-use are widespread tactics during assessments against organizations using Active Directory to manage their environment. It is often possible to obtain credentials in cleartext or re-use password hashes to further access via Pass-the-Hash or SMB Relay attacks. Still, some techniques will result in a password hash that must be cracked offline to further our access. Some examples include a NetNTLMv1 or NetNTLMv2 obtained through a Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, a Kerberos 5 TGS-REP hash obtained through a Kerberoasting attack, or an NTLM hash obtained either by dumping credentials from memory using the `Mimikatz` tool or obtained from a Windows machine's local SAM database.

---

#### NTLM

One example is retrieving an NTLM password hash for a user that has Remote Desktop (RDP) access to a server but is not a local administrator, so the NTLM hash cannot be used for a pass-the-hash attack to gain access. In this case, the cleartext password is necessary to further our access by connecting to the server via RDP and performing further enumeration within the network or looking for local privilege escalation vectors.

Let's walk through an example. We can quickly generate an NTLM hash of the password "`Password01`" for our purposes using 3 lines of Python:

#### Python3 - Hashlib

Cracking Common Hashes

```shell-session
underhill341@htb[/htb]$ python3

Python 3.8.3 (default, May 14 2020, 11:03:12) 
[GCC 9.3.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

>>> import hashlib,binascii
>>> hash = hashlib.new('md4', "Password01".encode('utf-16le')).digest()
>>> print (binascii.hexlify(hash))

b'7100a909c7ff05b266af3c42ec058c33'
```

We can then run the resultant NTLM password hash value "`7100a909c7ff05b266af3c42ec058c33`" through `Hashcat` using the standard `rockyou.txt` wordlist to retrieve the cleartext.

#### Hashcat - Cracking NTLM Hashes

```shell-session
underhill341@htb[/htb]$ hashcat -a 0 -m 1000 ntlm_example /opt/useful/seclists/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt

```

Now, armed with the cleartext password, we can further our access within the network.

#### NetNTLMv2

During a penetration test it is common to run tools such as [Responder](https://github.com/lgandx/Responder) to perform MITM attacks to attempt to "steal" credentials. These types of attacks are covered in-depth in other modules. In busy corporate networks it is common to retrieve many NetNTLMv2 password hashes using this method. These can often be cracked and leveraged to establish a foothold in the Active Directory environment or sometimes even gain full administrative access to many or all systems depending on the privileges granted to the user account associated with the password hash. Consider the password hash below retrieved using `Responder` at the beginning of an assessment:

```

Some tools, such as `Responder`, will inform you what type of hash was received. We can also check the [Example hashes](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes) page if in doubt and confirm that this is indeed a NetNTLMv2 hash, or mode `5600` in `Hashcat`.

As with the previous examples, we can run this hash with `Hashcat` using the `rockyou.txt` wordlist to perform an offline dictionary attack.
