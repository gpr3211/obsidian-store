Hybrid mode is a variation of the combinator attack, wherein multiple modes can be used together for a fine-tuned wordlist creation. This mode can be used to perform very targeted attacks by creating very customized wordlists. It is particularly useful when you know or have a general idea of the organization's password policy or common password syntax. The attack mode for the hybrid attack is "`6`".

Let's consider a password such as "`football1$`". The example below shows how a wordlist can be used in combination with a mask.

#### Creating Hybrid Hash

Hybrid Mode

```shell-session
 echo -n 'football1$' | md5sum | tr -d " -" > hybrid_hash
```

Hashcat reads words from the wordlist and appends a unique string based on the mask supplied. In this case, the mask "`?d?s`" tells hashcat to append a digit and a special character at the end of each word in the `rockyou.txt` wordlist.

Attack mode "`7`" can be used to prepend characters to words using a given mask. The following example shows a mask using a custom character set to add a prefix to each word in the `rockyou.txt` wordlist. The custom character mask "`20?1?d`" with the custom character set "`-1 01`" will prepend various years to each word in the wordlist (i.e., 2010, 2011, 2012..).
